# Heart_Disease_Prediction
This project is a Machine Learning model that predicts the likelihood of heart disease based on medical parameters. Built using Python in Google Colab, the model leverages Logistic Regression to analyze health data and provide early risk assessments. 

🚀 Features
✅ Data preprocessing & cleaning for accuracy
✅ Model training & evaluation using Scikit-Learn
✅ Predicts heart disease risk based on key health indicators
✅ Achieves promising training & test accuracy

🔧 Tech Stack
Python 🐍
Pandas & NumPy for data processing
Scikit-Learn for model building
Google Colab for development
📊 How It Works
1️⃣ Loads and processes medical dataset
2️⃣ Splits data into training & testing sets
3️⃣ Trains a Logistic Regression model
4️⃣ Predicts whether a person is at risk of heart disease

🎯 Next Steps
🔹 Improve model accuracy with more advanced ML techniques
🔹 Deploy the model into a web application for real-world use
